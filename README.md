## Hi, I'm Anuj ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ¯ðŸ¤–
I am working in Oracle as a Software Developer. Here at Oracle, I am primarily working in its health-tech sector. Before Oracle, I was part of Cognizant, where I worked on their health-tech project for the state of Maryland. I have working experience with a wide range of technologies. I am best described as a curious, agile, and hardworking individual.
Please feel free to contact me through any of the social media platforms mentioned in my profile. Thanks!!
